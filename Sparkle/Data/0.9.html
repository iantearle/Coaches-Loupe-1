        <ul>
	       <li>
	           <h1>Loupe Transparency</h1>
	           <span>The transparency of the loupe can now be adjusted from 10% to 100%.</span>
	       </li>
	       <li>
	           <h1>Shot Preview</h1>
	           <span>A preview image has been added to the information courts.</span>
	       </li>	       
	       <li>
	           <h1>Recent Shots</h1>
	           <span>In the 'Screenshot' menu there is now a list of recent shots. Clicking on a recent shot will opened the shot in a browser.</span>
	       </li>	       	       
	       <li>
	           <h1>Arrow Keys</h1>
	           <span>The code for the arrow keys has been completely redone and no longer requires the 'window' menu. This rewrite also fixed a bug that cause the arrow keys to move the loupe when a text field was active instead of moving the cursor. The arrow keys have the same behavior as before, they move the loupe 1px, 10px if the âŒ˜ key is down.</span>
	       </li>	  
	       <li>
	           <h1>Cancel Button</h1>
	           <span>Now that there is a shot preview in the information court it makes sense to have a cancel button so you can take the shot again if you don't like the preview.</span>
	       </li>	
	       <li>
	           <h1>Disable Buttons</h1>
	           <span>This is a minor item but the upload buttons and menu items are now disabled while a shot is being uploaded.</span>
	       </li>		         	            	       	       
	   </ul>
